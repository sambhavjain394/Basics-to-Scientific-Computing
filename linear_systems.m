%understand the difference between * and .*

% norm means length which is :
% ||x||= sqrt of x.x   inner product of x with itselfh

% if two matrices follow A*B=B*A , then they are said to be commute
% non singular matrices are those having non zero determinent

% in matlab, we find the determinant as det(A)   
% condition number is mre robust way to check whether its problamatic or not, rahter than calculating its determinant (as =0)
